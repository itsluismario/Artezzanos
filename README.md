# Artezzanos - a platform to open new frontiers to the greatest artist in Mexico

This e-commerce was built to support artists from unprivileged areas. The main reason we developed this channel was to create a new door for these talented people. Right now, they are living in a vicious cycle where their art is being sold to people who abused the unprivileged status of the artist and force them to sell their art for a bargain price. This obstacle interrupts the creation of financial and economical freedom and stops their options to grow as an artist.

Artezzanos was built using Django as a framework. It is ready to connect to Openpay (a system for payment methods - https://site.openpay.mx/en/index.html). Its last version only requires resetting the user´s password. Besides that, it is ready to run. 

Features: 
  - Cookies: It tracks the cart of the user and unknown user. In other words, it is not requiered to log-in to know the selected items. 
  - Log-in for buying: The user needs to create an account to click "purchase".
  - Multi-addresses: They user can have many addresses.
  - Admin-section: The admin can update the stocks through django-admin
  - Hours spent: Each art depicts how many hours was taken to create the art piece.

Why did we develop this website, and we did not use a third-party to start selling?  
  - The main purpose is to give the highest margin possible to the artist, but this is not possible when the third-parties charge you 10% of your selling
  - The UX designs that were found were complex and did not have any option to represent our most valuable thing, the hours spent on each art piece. 
  - The product that we wanted to develop was´nt complex at all, so it was very quick to develop and implement.
