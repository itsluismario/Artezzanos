# Artezzanos - a plataform that open new frontiers to the greatest artist in Mexico

Artezzanos is a plataform that aims to create new oportuninites to the mancrafts of Mexico to have more selling spots without the need of moving out of their town and use their time to create unique and valuable art pieces. Right now, the artist has been forced to sell their handcrafts for a bargain price by people who take advantage of their unprivileged position.
