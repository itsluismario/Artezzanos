# Artezzanos - a platform to open new frontiers to the greatest artist in Mexico

This e-commerce was built to support artists from unprivileged areas. The main reason we developed this channel was to create a new door for these talented people. Right now, they are living in a vicious cycle where their art is being sold to people who abused the unprivileged status of the artist and force them to sell their art for a bargain price. This obstacle interrupts the creation of financial and economical freedom and stops their options to grow as an artist.

Artezzanos was built using Django as a framework. It is ready to connect to Openpay. Its last version only requires resetting the userÂ´s password. Besides that, it is ready to run.
